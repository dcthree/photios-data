It differs from 'etnos' in that, soup is prepared from beans or peas or simply any kind of mashed legume, but porridge, as has been said, is prepared from wheat that has been boiled and liquified. And usage of the word is frequent among the Attic [writers], sometimes preferred with the eta on the end, and the alpha in the middle, but according to many others with the alpha on the end and the eta in the middle. So both Hellanicus and Sophron employed it. But they also lengthen the alpha, as if the word had been changed from 'athêra'. But perhaps, they say, the word was at first 'athera' with the epsilon, namely the food refined from chaff and boiled from wheat, but later the epsilon was lengthened to eta, just as [the lengthening of] 'ethos' to 'êthos'. And while 'athera' has become 'athara' in Doric, those who say 'atharê' are speaking Ionic. For in fact they also employed other Ionic words on account of their kinship of old, always saying 'esêmênamên' (we denoted) and 'sêmênamenos' (denoted). As a result, the word 'atharê' as said by the Attic writers kept its penult according to the Doric dialect, but its ultima according to the Ionic.",Edited by Joshua D. Sosin <joshuad.sosin@gmail.com>
