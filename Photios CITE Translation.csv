It differs from 'etnos' in that, soup is prepared from beans or peas or simply any kind of mashed legume, but porridge, as has been said, is prepared from wheat that has been boiled and liquified. And usage of the word is frequent among the Attic [writers], sometimes preferred with the eta on the end, and the alpha in the middle, but according to many others with the alpha on the end and the eta in the middle. So both Hellanicus and Sophron employed it. But they also lengthen the alpha, as if the word had been changed from 'athêra'. But perhaps, they say, the word was at first 'athera' with the epsilon, namely the food refined from chaff and boiled from wheat, but later the epsilon was lengthened to eta, just as [the lengthening of] 'ethos' to 'êthos'. And while 'athera' has become 'athara' in Doric, those who say 'atharê' are speaking Ionic. For in fact they also employed other Ionic words on account of their kinship of old, always saying 'esêmênamên' (we denoted) and 'sêmênamenos' (denoted). As a result, the word 'atharê' as said by the Attic writers kept its penult according to the Doric dialect, but its ultima according to the Ionic.",Edited by Joshua D.

So, if the word is monosyllabic, when it is by itself, it establishes an absolute meaning, but when used as a part of a word the alpha denotes privation, as in 'anandros' (un-manly), 'akakon' (un-harmed), but it also indicates greatness, as in “wide-mouthed ('achanes') sea,” but also plenitude as in “in much-wooded ('axulo') woods,” and commonality, as in 'adelphos' (brother), one from the same womb ('delphys') or cervix, and badness, as in 'amechane' (unmanageable), for 'kakomechane' (evil-plotting) and other such.",Edited by Clinton Kinkade <clinton.kinkade@gmail.com>,

Having said these things he at once built a dwelling underground. Then, disappearing suddenly from the Thracians, he lived in this place. The Getai longed for him. In the fourth year he appeared again, and the Thracians believed him in everything. Some say Zamolxis was a slave to Pythagoras the Samian, son of Mnesarchus, and he played these tricks when he had been freed. But it seems to me that Zamolxis lived much earlier than Pythagoras. But the Terizoi and Krobuzoi consider themselves immortal, and they say that those that have died depart like Zamolxis, but will come again.

Therefore, it seems, it is called Pyanepsia, like Kyanepsia, since they used to call kyamoi (beans) pyanoi. They used to hold it when they needed to ward off famine, and the children sang the following: “Eiresione bears figs and fat loaves and honey in the comb and olive oil for anointing and an unmixed cup, so that you get drunk and go to sleep.” After the festival they place them from the fields beside their doors.

Since it became hot on the road he wanted to rest under the shadow of the ass. For there was no tree nor any such thing. But the ass-driver forbade him, claiming that he had only hired out the ass to him, not its shadow as well. And thus there was a serious discussion and contentiousness to them concerning this. And having said these things, when he saw the Athenians paying much attention and desiring and yearning to hear what came next, he rebuked them, since they ask and beseech to hear about an ass' shadow, but do not wish to listen on behalf of a man who is at risk over his life.

But Timaios [says] that those who had lived in Sardinia for a sufficiently long time would laugh when they were being driven with wooden staves by their sons into the pit in which they were going to be buried. But others [say] it is from grinning with grief. Others and Kleitarchos also say that in Carthage during great prayers they place a child into the hands of Kronos. And a bronze [statue] is set up with outstretched hands, under which there is a baking oven. Then [they say] they set fire beneath it. And the one who is shriveled up by the fire seems to smile. But Simonides [says] that Talos, the Hephaistos-crafted man, when the Sardinians did not wish to hand him over to Minos, leaping into the fire apparently because he was bronze, taking them to his breast, killed them while they gaped. But Silenos in the fourth book of the Concerning Syracusans [says] there is among the Sardinians an herb that is sweet, resembling celery, and those who taste which bite away at their cheeks and flesh. But some [apply it to] those who laugh at evil, just as Homer says that Odysseus [did]: ""And god-like Odysseus smiled sardonically ('sardonion')."" And in other lines: ""And she laughed with her lips. But the face upon her dusky brows was not warmed.""",,

'To be eager' means to be very stirred up for doing or hearing something. On the whole they use the word variously. For it also means 'to wet', as Archilochus [uses it]. Aischylos applies it also to driving out while beating and to softening. Sophokles in Ageis &lt;says&gt; that Theseus by bending and softening withes made a chain for the bull. He says thus: “eager with the spindles of his hands he added corded chains.” also Herodotos in the fourth [book] used 'orgasas' (having kneaded) for 'malaxas' (having softened). Surely then since the word indicates 'to soften' and 'to wet', 'to swell/be ripe' and 'to be elevated' is said for 'to be eager'. Also for wet things swell a bit. One must note also thus the force of the word. Also called 'orgades' are all the things that are let go to wood and untilled and idle, as also Solon says. After this therefore 'to be eager' is said applying to being given over to doing or hearing something. Or since the 'orgades' by being uncut will increase in height, owing to this 'to be eager' also indicates 'to be elevated' and 'raised up' to do or hear something. It seems to me also that 'oringnasthai' (to be stretched out) and 'orge' arose also from here, being as it were, a stretching and aiming and increase and elevation of the soul.
